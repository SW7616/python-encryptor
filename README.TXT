Not much to state here other than its an encryptor in python!
In detail, this script generates a key if you want to encrypt* something and saves that key in a file for future reference 
and encrypts what you want to encrypt, be it a file or just some text.
It also can decrypt* a file, or text. You need the key for the encrypted stuff though.
limitations,
- cant encrypt entire folders,
- you may want to be carefull about encrypting large items.

* - this script only supports fernet encryption.
